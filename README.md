# Milpa Card Game

This is a card game that I created for my friends and I to play. I love board games and wanted to use the opportunity to try new things and learn new skills. I also wanted to use the new GitHub Copilot Chat to help me with the code.

## Installation

Start by installing direnv and then run `direnv allow` in the root of the project. This will set up the environment variables for you. Then make the install script executable and run it.

```bash
chmod +x cmd/install
```

Then run the install script. If direnv is properly set up, you can just run the following command.

```bash
install --os=macos
```
