## What is Milpa - Card Game?

Milpa is a card game where two players compete to grow the best milpa. A milpa is a traditional Mesoamerican agricultural system that has been used for thousands of years. It is a sustainable way of growing crops that takes advantage of the different layers of the ecosystem. The milpa is a polyculture system that grows corn, beans, and squash together. The corn provides a structure for the beans to grow on, the beans provide nitrogen to the soil, and the squash provides ground cover to prevent weeds from growing.
